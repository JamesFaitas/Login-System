# Login-System
A web page is required that offers users the opportunity to either log in with existing credentials orregister to create an account. Log in credentials will involve an email address (which serves as a username) and a password. When users register they should be prompted to enter an email address and choose their own password, which must have 8 characters or more, including at least one number and one letter. Any other characters are not allowed. When a new user joins, the system should check whether their email address is already in use and, if it is, not allow them to create a new account. It should also check that the email address provided has a valid format. You only need to ask them to provide a name, an email and a password to join. The password should be validated at both the client and the server and users should be warned if they enter an email address that is already in use BEFORE they submit the form. Users should be offered a facility that sends them a new password if they have forgotten theirs if they provide their email address. Once a user is logged in, the system should allow them to view other pages that are only accessible following a recent login. Those pages should ask users who are not already logged in to do so
